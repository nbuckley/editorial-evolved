<p><b>Hello & Welcome to my blog. :)</b> My name is <a href="https://nathanjbuckley.com/">Nathan</a> and here I share my thoughts on the many facets of life and the future I believe virtually all of us desire. If you are new to the site, I recommend starting with the <a href="https://nathanjbuckley.com/blog/table-of-contents/">Foundation Posts</a>: they serve as an introduction to my core beliefs that are the foundation for all my other beliefs and provide insight as to how I came to think this way. Importantly, this should enable you as a reader to reach a baseline understanding of me and the way I reason so that you are better equipped to understand much of my discourse moving forward.</p>
<p>Beyond that, <b>any other blog post can be read in any order</b>, except as otherwise noted. You can find posts by clicking on any of the tags (topic categories) associated with every post, or by selecting topics from the <b>sidebar</b> (click the <em>hamburger icon</em> [<i class="fas fa-bars"></i>] in the upper-left to toggle it), or by using the <a href="https://nathanjbuckley.com/blog/table-of-contents/">Table of Contents</a> which provides a complete index of all topic categories along with search functionality.</p>
<p>I am honored to have you here, and I hope you enjoy my writing. As always, don't hesitate to <a href="https://nathanjbuckley.com/blog/contact/">reach out to me</a> if there's anything on your mind. :)<p>
<p><em>Ever Warmly,</em><br/>
